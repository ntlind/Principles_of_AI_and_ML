# Principles of AI & ML
Presentation on Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning that I delivered to 80+ Wharton students / faculty in Fall 2017. In this presentation, Jerry Lu and I aimed to:
* Define Artificial Intelligence (AI) and describe its applications in business
* Discuss major drivers and influencers that are shaping the future of AI / ML
* Dive into Machine Learning (ML) and decode buzzwords such as “deep learning” and “cognitive computing”
* Highlight analytical techniques and best practices used in AI / ML
* Share opportunities for students to get involved in Penn’s data science community
